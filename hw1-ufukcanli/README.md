# Week 1

## This repository includes the first week's homeworks of the bootcamp.

1. Print the fibonacci numbers between 750 and 1000.\
I've written a function that prints the fibonacci numbers between the numbers that you choose.

2. Make a git flow example.\
I've created a "main" branch then "development" branch and then "feature" branch. Checked out to development branch and made some changes and committed the changes. After that created another branch called feature1 and made some changes there. I checked out to the development branch and merged the feature1 branch. Finally checked out to the main branch and merged the development branch. After all of these I created another branch called "feature2" and made some changes there, I checked out the main branch and cherry picked the feature2 branch. After all, I created a feature3 branch and made some changes again. Then checked out the development. And rebase the feature3.

Thanks for stopping by!
